- What is the difference between statement and expression in C# ?

# Statements:

* Functionality: Statements execute instructions and control the flow of execution within your C# program. They do not directly produce a value but may have side effects, such as:
- Modifying variables
- Performing I/O operations (e.g., printing to the console)
- Transferring control flow using conditional statements and loops

* Examples:
int x = 5; // Variable declaration and assignment
if (x > 10) { ... } // Conditional statement
while (true) { ... } // Looping statement
----------------------------
# Expressions:

Functionality: Expressions evaluate to a specific value, which can be used for various purposes within your program. They do not cause side effects and focus solely on computation or retrieval.

* Examples:
2 + 3 // Evaluates to 5 (integer arithmetic)
"Hello" + " World" // Combines strings
Math.Sqrt(16) // Calls a function and returns a value
x * 2 // Uses a variable in an expression
